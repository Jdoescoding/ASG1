# ASG1
# Ronohs Electronics
For this assignment I will be creating a website. The purpose of this website is to promote a fictional company that makes and sells electronics. It also shows us what other services are provided by it

It also mentions its history and values 

Here is what I will cover: 
1. What the company does
2. History of the company
3. Achievements and Accolades by the company
4. Contact Information
5. Products it sells (currently)
6. Best selling products 
7. Latest news 

It will also include:
1. A sign in/sign up button
2. Search bar to look for products
3. Promotion code bar
4. Price range buttons
5. Warranty registration

# Design Process
I used the colors blue, light blue and dark green for my website as I found that they are able to complement each other and this colour combination is extremely pleasing to the eye. 
My aim for this website is so users can know more about what this company does and also for current fans to buy their products. It also allows new fans to know about this company and why they should buy their products, as seen by the "About Us" and "Shop". I made the website navigation easy and more pleasing to the eye so people can navigate through the website more easily.

I created this to better visualize my website and also understand how it will look before I start creating it.

# Testing
I tested by installing the "Live Server" Extension on VS Code so that I do not have to keep refreshing my website everytime I make changes to it. I made sure everything can be seen clearly and can be accessed easily by anyone without confusion.
